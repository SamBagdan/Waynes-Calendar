# Waynes-Calendar
The intention of this project was really just for me to revisit javaFX
as well as build a calendar schedule generator for my step-dad who
was previously writing down his schedule on our home calendar by hand.
This code is an abomination to the model-view-controller design pattern.
Originally in the class where I first learned about javaFX, I
implemented the pattern.  However, when I wrote this over the summer I
sort of just absolutely butchered it in favor of time.
